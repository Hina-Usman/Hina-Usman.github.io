<em> Economic Insecurity and Racially Motivated Crimes (with Usman Ghaus) </em> <br>
Abstract: In this paper, we identify the relationship between economic insecurity and racially motivated crimes. Treating 09/11 attacks  as an exogenous shock to racial animus among Americans, we find that the attacks immediately increased hate crimes against certain ethnic and religious groups. We compare the magnitude of temporal discontinuity in hate crimes, followed by the September 11 attacks, across counties in the upper and lower quartiles of unemployment rates in the year 2000. Consistent with evidence on the adverse effects of unemployment on subjective well-being, our results show that the discontinuity in average daily hate crimes is 326 percent higher in counties that are in the fourth quartile of unemployment compared to the first quartile of unemployment. </div>

<em> "Shall I educate my daughter or protect her?" - Fear of Victimization and Enrollment Choices in Rural Pakistan </em> <br> 
 Abstract: I study the effect of a father’s fear related to his daughter’s security when she is traveling to school on enrollment outcomes for the daughter in rural Pakistan. Using the first wave of the Pakistan Rural Household Panel Survey-2012, I use an instrumental variable strategy to estimate the relationship between the father’s fear and the educational outcomes of the daughter. The results show that if a father feels worried about his children’s security when they are traveling to school, the probability that the daughter  will ever attend school falls by 45 percent. The findings also suggest that the gender of the firstborn child affects the parent’s fear, and the probability that a father feels fearful falls by 7.7 percent if the firstborn is a male. Moreover, females without an older brother are 14.3 percent less likely to attend school. The estimates highlight a positive spillover effect of having an eldest brother on enrollment choices of younger females in the family. The findings present suggestive evidence that the presence of an older son reduces parents fear, as older sons walk with younger siblings when they travel to school and ensure route safety for younger sisters. From a policy perspective, the findings emphasize the provision of route safety for females in rural areas.</div>

<em> Policing and the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic (with Taylor McKay and Emily Owens) </em> <br> 
Abstract: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic prompted dramatic declines in social mobility and sweeping policy responses across all levels of government within the United States. In this paper, we assess the impact of the pandemic on policing across three major police departments. Using geolocated calls for service records, we document substantial declines in aggregate demand for policing following the pandemic. Importantly, however, this decline in demand is not consistent across all types of calls. We find that driving-related calls for service declines fell precipitously, while other call types remained relatively unaffected or increased. Additionally, we use Census tract-level demographic data to identify communities most affected by these shifts in policing.</div>
